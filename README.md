NOTE:- Created this website to experience SASS. 
Here are some major advantages I came across while coding in SASS:-
  1. U can use variables.
  2. U can use Variable Mappings.
  3. U can nest within a tag, i.e. Nesting is permitted.
  4. U can use functions in sass, but u can declare a function using "@function".
  5. U can do math in SASS.... example.
